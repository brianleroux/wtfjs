Have you ever thought that `Array(3)` will return you array of 3 `undefined`'s same as `[undefined,undefined,undefined]`?

So try this:
```
    Array(3).forEach(function(elem) { console.log(elem); });
```
And you will get no result at all, however
```
    [undefined,undefined,undefined].forEach(function(elem) { console.log(elem); });
```
will give you 3 nice log entries.

Are first `undefined`'s less defined than second ones?

Not really. According to [forEach spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.4.4.18): "`callbackfn` is called only for elements of the array which actually *exist*", and [constructor spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.4.2.2) says nothing about putting there any (even undefined) element.
