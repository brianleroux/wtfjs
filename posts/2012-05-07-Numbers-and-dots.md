A JavaScript syntax oddity with Numbers and Dots:

```
// Ok, you may have seen wrapping a number literal with parens to call Number methods
(42).toFixed(2); // "42.00"
// And it is understandable that without parens you get a syntax error
42.toFixed(2); // SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal
// But numbers with decimals work fine without parens (WTF?)
42.888.toFixed(2); // "42.89"
// And whole numbers with two dots work as well (WTF?)
42..toFixed(2); // "42.00"
// Hey, so what about 3 dots!? Firefox gives XML-related error (WTF?)
42...toFixed(2); // TypeError: XML descendants internal method called on incompatible Number
```
