[The spec of ECMAScript](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.8.2.13) specifies some default values of `Math.pow`.

```
    console.log(Math.pow(NaN, 42) === NaN)
```

[Oops, sorry.](http://wtfjs.com/2010/02/12/not-a-number-is-not-a-not-a-number)

```
    console.log(Math.pow(NaN, 42)); // NaN
```

As you can see, if the first argument is `NaN`, `Math.pow` returns `NaN`, which is quite normal.
However, there's an exception: when the second argument is `0` (`+0` or `-0`).

```
    console.log(Math.pow(NaN, 0)); // 1
```

When the second argument is `0`, then `Math.pow` should return `1`, no matter what the first argument is.
This can be considered as a normal behavior, unless...

```
    console.log(Math.pow(Infinity, 0), Math.pow(0, 0)); // Still 1?
```

Basically the spec asserts values of some [indeterminate forms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminate_forms).
Sure, some can argue that lim(x->infinity) x^0 is zero (infinity is not a real number, anyway) and 0^0 is [usually considered as one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation#Zero_to_the_power_of_zero), but according to the same spec...

```
    console.log(Math.pow(1, Infinity)); // NaN
```

So 1^infinity is `NaN` while infinity^0 is `0`. Great.
