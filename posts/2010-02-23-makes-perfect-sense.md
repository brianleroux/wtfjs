Ha! This one is great. 

```
3 > 2 > 1 // false
```

Remember how [true sometimes has a value](/2010/02/15/true-has-a-value) so in the above 3 > 2 evaluates to true making the second part of the expression evaluate true > 1 which is false. Of course! Thanks to [void_0](http://twitter.com/void_0) for this one!
