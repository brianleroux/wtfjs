Not really an oddity about JavaScript itself but rather a result of these oddities. If you are into esotheric programming languages, you might have heared about [BrainFuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck). There is a JavaScript version of that. It's called—you probably already guessed it—[JSFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSFuck). And it doesn't stop there: While BrainFuck has to be compiled, JSFuck makes use of JavaScript's unique \*coughs\* features to just work out of the box. And if you think, esotheric languages aside, entertainment aside, there's no real use to them at the end of the day, I tell you, you couldn't be more wrong—but I don't blame you. It is used for security matters—as an [obfuscation technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)), to be more precise.

# Example
## JavaScript
```javascript
alert(1)
```

## JSFuck
```javascript
