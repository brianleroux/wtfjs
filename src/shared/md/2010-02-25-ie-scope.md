[@jaffathecake](http://twitter.com/jaffathecake) has some more fun with IE. As we do.

<pre lang="javascript">
    window.window == window // true
    window.window === window // false
    window == document // true. wtf!
</pre>

[@filmaj](http://twitter.com/filmaj) says, “I think it’s because object equality implicitly calls toString(), and in IE most native DOM objects return just ‘[object]’ in toString(), whereas standard browser return something like ‘[object ClassName]’, which is probably why WebKit doesn’t do the same thing.”

Fuckin IE, eh.
