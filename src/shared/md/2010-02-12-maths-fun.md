Clearly JavaScript is not the most beautiful, or intuitive, language for maths.

```
    typeof NaN === 'number' // true
    Infinity === 1/0        // true
    0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3       // false
```
Julia Evans wrote a little [explanation as to why that happens](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/08/why-does-0-1-plus-0-2-equal-0-30000000000000004/) in her blog.
