Let's take the last post a step further:

```
    console.log( (![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]] ) // "fail"
```

Breaking that mass of symbols into pieces we notices, that the following patten occurs often:

```
    console.log( (![]+[]) ) // "false"
    console.log( ![] ) // false
```

So we try adding `[]` to `false`. But through a number of internal function calls( `binary + Operator` -> `ToPrimitive` -> `[[DefaultValue]]`) we end up with converting the right operand to a String:

```
    console.log( [].toString() ) // ""
    console.log( (![]+[].toString()) ) // false + ""
```

Aha, so we are concatenating strings here! Now this is plain obvious! Moving on to the next bit:

```
    console.log( [+[]] ) // [ 0]
    console.log( +[] ) // 0
```

Thinking of a `String` as an `Array` we can access its first character via `[0]`. So `"false"[0]` returns `"f"`.

I think you got the idea now and can figure out the rest by yourself!
