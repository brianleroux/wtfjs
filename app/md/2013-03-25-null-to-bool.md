```
    null == false // false
```
Okay, we know this. Null doesn't convert to boolean.

Now try this...
```
    !null // true
```

Well, this is awkward.

The issue here is that Null **can** be converted to a boolean, it just
isn't **implicitly** converted:
```
    Boolean(null) // false
```

See [The Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm](http://es5.github.io/#x11.9.3)  
Null is only implicitly converted if compared to `undefined`
