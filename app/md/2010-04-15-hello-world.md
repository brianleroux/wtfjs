At first, wtfjs was a silly little thought experiment. Almost like a solution log except documenting potential traps instead of, ya know, actual solutions! I set the whole thing up in 10 minutes w/ <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> and the help of <a href="http://gist.github.com/">GitHub Gists</a>. This served well enough to get things started but, as always, there was room for improvement. The rss feed didn't show the code samples. Hosting a site about JavaScript should probably be written <em>in JavaScript</em>. For purity. And science. 

Anyhow, welcome to the new blog. Here's the score:

- 100% cloud friendly SSJS. Deployed on <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> with <a href="http://nodejs.com">NodeJS</a>.
- Microframework! Utilizes the awesome sauce that is <a href="http://expressjs.com">ExpressJS</a>.
- Totally open source. <a href="http://github.com/brianleroux/wtfjs">Fork wtfjs.com GitHub.</a>

Sure, there were a few wtf's along the way. Heroku literally just squeezed NodeJS hosting a few short weeks ago and it is not without a couple of occasional rough edges. 

The bonus of this reauthor is also an improved workflow for contribution. Fork the repo. Add your post in the posts folder. Send me a pull request. Easy.

what did I learn?
---

- Package management in serverside js land is still a total fuck up.
- Heroku and Express have awesome communities; whenever I had a question folks really helped.
- jsftw! The future is here. This code blog can be forked and deployed live in literally one minute. 

Have fun! - <a href="http://twitter.com/brianleroux">brianleroux</a>
