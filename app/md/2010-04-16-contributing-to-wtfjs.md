<a href="http://github.com/brianleroux/wtfjs">Fork the source on GitHub</a> and then add your post to the posts/ folder. The title has to be of the format: 

**_yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-article.md_**

The post itself is markdown. Code blocks go into a code element. Its assumed any code is JavaScript (and subsequently syntax highlighted as such) but you can specify other language types. You might have to grab <a href="http://shjs.sourceforge.net/lang/">extra language files</a>. Thats it.
