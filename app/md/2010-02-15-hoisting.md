```
    (function(){
        alert(window);  // "undefined"
        var window = window;
    })();
```

Because of “hoisting”, all variable *declarations* will be executed immediately at the top of a function scope. However, the variable *initializations* are not hoisted. So, local variable “window” is declared but uninitialized/”undefined”. wt-fun!
