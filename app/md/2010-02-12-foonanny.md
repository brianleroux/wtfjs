Evaluted as `"foo" + (+ "bar")`, which converts “bar” to not a number.

Proposal to rename this site: NaNwtf

<code>
    ("foo" + + "bar") === "fooNaN" // true
</code>

**Explanation**
1. `+"bar"` calls `"bar".valueOf()` which tries to return a number
2. Because "bar" is a string, it returns `NaN` instead
3. `"foo"` is concatenated with `NaN`
4. Because of the concatenation `NaN.toString()` is called which results in `"foo" + "NaN"`
